## Setting up your own CSOPESY project
- Create your first-ever main menu. Use only the C++ built-in libraries.
- Provide your ASCII text header “CSOPESY” or a name for your command line emulator.
- Set up template code that accepts the following commands: marquee, screen, process-smi, nvidia-smi, clear, exit. Simply print “X command recognized. Doing something.”, where X is the command recognized.
- For the clear command, once recognized, the screen clears, reprinting the header texts.
- For the exit command, the application/CLI immediately closes.

## Submit an MP4 video of you compiling + running your own CLI with the following guidelines:
- Your video must be seamless and not cut. The minimum video quality should be at least 480p and a maximum of 720p. Please ensure that the font size of your IDE is large enough to be readable on video.
- Maximum video size should be limited to 1GB. 
- You are not allowed to access/modify your code while performing the test case. 
- The video should always show you pressing Run/Debug from your IDE, which should initialize your program. Once running, you are not allowed to exit from your program and attempt to modify your code.
